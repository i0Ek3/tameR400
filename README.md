# tameR400

> Tame ThinkPad R400(1 GB Mem + 250 GB HHD).

Yesterday, I found a laptop(R400) in our cabinet. First look, I will throw it away, but I give it a chance and it returns me a gift. What a nice thing, I'll use it as a server.


## What R400 Looks Like?

You can find the other pictures under the images.

## Configuration

![](![lubuntu-config](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/i0Ek3/apichost@main/lubuntu-config.2442lxqyfe3k.webp))


## Issues

- The battery was broken, must connect AC adapter all the time
- Low memory
- You tell me


## Hackin


### Hardware Disassembly

Just a simple way: add or remove something, like memory, disk etc.

After I disassemble the R400, I found there are two slots we can use, and one is 1G RAM meomory, another is empty. Nothing can be found about M.2 slot or mSATA interface.




### Setting BIOS

First, upgrade BIOS version if available. Actually R400 is old enough, I didn't find a BIOS software.

Second, setting BIOS configs.




### Install Linux

I just tried so many Linux distros, finnally I choose Lubuntu 18.04 i386/i686 as default system cause of low memory and performance consideration.

If you like, the other Linux distros also will be fine.




### Install Packages

Install some common packages like vim, zsh, tmux, git, neofetch/screenfetch, openssh-server etc.




### Setting For A Server

Enable Nginx and SSH first.

TODO(Actually I just want to give up, cause of this stuff's broken battery and low memory, but I will considerate a lot.)




### Relive

Check it out.




## What The Next?

I have no idea.
